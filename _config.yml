  desc: I am a software engineering student at ETS, finishing my third year with a strong passion for innovation and technology. While I possess a diverse range of interests – from aerospace and artificial intelligence to robotics – it's quantum computing that captivates me the most. I am keenly interested in pursuing an internship outside Québec in this field. My ambition, energy, and motivation have driven me to work on various coding/research projects in my free time. I invite you to explore my portfolio and see the potential I can bring to your organization. Welcome!   # Describe yourself.
