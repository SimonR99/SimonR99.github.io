- name: Light control with camera
  i18n: light
  img: /static/assets/img/projects/camera.jpg
  desc: The project has the goal to control my home with a camera.
  modalDescription : I got some smart lights as a birthday present and these can be controlled by phone or by voice with google. As I found that these methods were not worthy of the 21st century, I took a raspberry pi, installed home assistant and I created a script which makes it possible to control the light with a camera. So when I'm watching a movie and I want to turn off the light, I just point it and it turns off.

  modalDescription : This project was done in collaboration with Daniel Bilodeau. I took care of the programming part and he took care of the mechanical and electrical part. We have created a tool to keep 3D printing spools dry. For this project, I used Django to make a responsive website that offers the possibility to see the humidity history of a DryBox, to provide an authentication system and to provide an update firmware server for an esp8266.
